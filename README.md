ðŸ§­ EverShop GitOps Project
This project is part of my internship assignment focused on implementing a GitOps deployment workflow using Kubernetes, Helm, and Argo CD.

The purpose of this project is to:

Deploy and manage a real-world Node.js e-commerce application (EverShop) in a Kubernetes environment

Containerize and manage both the application and its PostgreSQL database

Convert raw Kubernetes YAML into Helm charts for modular and reusable infrastructure

Push all configuration (infrastructure and app settings) to a GitHub repository to serve as the single source of truth

Enable automatic deployments and updates through GitOps principles using Argo CD

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used:
Kubernetes (Minikube): Local cluster setup

Helm: Packaging the app and database as charts

Docker Hub: Pulling prebuilt images

GitHub: Version control and source of truth

Argo CD : Continuous delivery and synchronization
